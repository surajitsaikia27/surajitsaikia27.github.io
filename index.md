## Introduction
I am currently doing my PhD in the field of Artificial Intelligence, where my task is to build state-of-the-art algorithms with regards to object detection, image retrieval and scene recognition using deep learning. Before starting my PhD, I have completed my M.Tech in computer science and M.Sc in Mathematics. My areas of interest include Deep Reinforcement learning, 3D vision, Scene Understanding, and Computer vision. 

Apart from dealing with academics, I like painting, videography, adventure sports (roller skating, Hiking, surfing) and Music. I do play the Piano, Guitar, and was a saxophonist in my University band. Moreover, I welcome new opportunities in my life that would allow me to contribute towards creating a better world and to serve humanity.

 * In this video, a car learns to drive using deep reinforcement learning and Unity ML.  The environment was created using UNITY 3D,  and C# code was used to assign colliders and reward functions.  After training for several rounds using proximal policy optimization update, the car learns to reach the target
